#Property Editors#

A Property Editor is the editor that a Data Type references. A Data Type is defined by a user in the Umbraco backoffice and references a Property Editor. A Property Editor on the other hand is defined in C# by a developer and compiled into a DLL. 

When creating a data type, you specify the property editor for the data type to use by selecting from the "Render control" list (as shown below)
